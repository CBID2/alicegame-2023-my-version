# alicegame-2023
Hacktoberfest 2023 version of The Alice in Wonderland Project

## Update by Founder/Maintainer: October 11, 2023

**Unfortunately, on October 1st, I woke up sick for the first time in almost two years.** 
- I ended up being _very_ sick. 
- I'm back functioning as of today. 
- The Alice in Wonderland Project is still on for this Hacktoberfest. 
- I'm starting by doing a bit of reorganizing with the team leads today and tomorrow. (Refactoring but with people and timelines.)
